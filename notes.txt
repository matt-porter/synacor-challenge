== Ruins ==
You stand in the massive central hall of these ruins.  The walls are crumbling, and vegetation has clearly taken over.  Rooms are attached in all directions.  There is a strange monument in the center of the hall with circular slots and unusual symbols.  It reads:

_ + _ * _^2 + _^3 - _ = 399

import itertools
values = (2,3,5,7,9)
perms = itertools.permutations(values)
for p in perms:
    a,b,c,d,e = p
    res = a+b*c**2+d**3-e
    if res == 399:
      print("{} + {} * {}^2 + {}^3 - {} = {}".format(a,b,c,d,e, a+b*c**2+d**3-e))
